"simplepf.f90" stands for "Simple Potential Flow", 
a Fortran 90 program that solves 2D potential flow problems. 
It is designed as instructional material for the 6th-semester Ocean Engineering course at Institut Teknologi Sumatera.

The program solves a boundary value problem governed by the Laplace equation on an L-shaped domain. 
It applies a Dirichlet boundary condition (BC) on the left side and Neumann BCs on the other boundaries.
The iteration scheme follows an explicit method, and the simplicity of the BC assignment allows users to modify it effortlessly.
